## **I-View-U project aims to improve the quality and reproduciblity of scientific literature review by providing a systematic and standardized workflow.**

This workflow contains three stages: (1)Depict the Background Structure for the Research Question(DB);
(2)General Background Investigation(GB);
(3)Academic Background Investigation(AB). Each of the stage involves its own workflow.
