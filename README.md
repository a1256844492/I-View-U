## **I-View-U is a systematic literature review workflow, which aims to (1) provide an environment where curiosity could efficiently thrive into accurate scientific questions; (2) systematically synthesize the literature evidence needed to answer the question**

**âœ¨A recent live demo of I-View-U, check it out!(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1f7EMzmEFJ/)**

This workflow contains three stages: (1)Depict the Background Structure for the Research Question(DB);
(2)General Background Investigation(GB);
(3)Academic Background Investigation(AB). Each of the stage involves its own workflow.
